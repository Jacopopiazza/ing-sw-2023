## Setup

- In the [Deliverables](deliverables) folder there are two multi-platform jar files, one to set the Server up, and the other one to start the Client.
- The Server can be run with the following command, the RMI port is 1099, the socket port is 1234:
    ```shell
    > java -jar MyShelfie_Server.jar
    ```
  This command can be followed by these arguments:
    - **-hostname**: followed by the desired hostname for the RMI server as argument (usually the IP of the network interface);

- The Client can be run with the following command:
    ```shell
    > java -jar MyShelfie_Client.jar
    ```
    - This command sets the Client on Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode, but it can be followed by **-cli** if the Command Line Interface (CLI) is preferred.
    - The Server's IP to connect to can be specified during the execution.
